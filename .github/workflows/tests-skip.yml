# This is just a dummy workflow to handle skipped but required branch
# protection status checks
# (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).
# In the repository settings, one can specify workflows that must finish
# successfully before a pull request can be merged with the protected
# branch.  However, these required workflows might not be triggered by
# all pull requests, depending on the triggering rules of the workflow.
# To handle the case when a workflow is required but not triggered,
# create a dummy workflow with exactly the same name as the required
# workflow that is always triggered when the required workflow is not
# triggered and that simulates a successful workflow run.  See
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks
# However, be aware that both workflows are triggered if two (or more)
# files are changed and one of them is listed in the requested
# workflow's `paths` list (which is the same as this workflow's
# `paths-ignore` list) and the other is not.  See
# https://github.com/github/docs/issues/21865

# Keep in sync with `test.yml`.
