Developer's Guide

Thank you for your willingness to contribute to HPC Submit Scripts!  Any
help is highly appreciated!

Although you certainly want to start right away, please take a while and
get familiar with the style guide this project follows.  Maintaining a
consistent code is much easier and thus more fun than maintaining a
mess.

    comfortable with that *before* you contribute to the project.
