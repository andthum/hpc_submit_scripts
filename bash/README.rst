Bash Scripts that are used by some of the Slurm job scripts in this
project.

Some of the scripts can be used indpendently as stand-alone scripts,
other scripts only operate together with Slurm job scripts.  For
stand-alone scripts, type :bash:`path/to/script.sh -h` in a terminal to
get a help message how to use the script.
